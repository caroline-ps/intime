I realized my In-Time project one year ago, before I started my UX Design course. 
I learned HTML, CSS and VUE.js and wanted to apply my knowleadge in a practical project. 

I realized a simple website that, using a free API from The New York Times, allows people to 
search for articles and save them as favourites. 

This hobby-project was mainly focused on the technical aspects of frontend, and not the UX Design.
