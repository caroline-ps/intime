# In-Time - A reading platform

I realized my In-Time project one year ago, before I started my UX Design course. 
I learned HTML, CSS and VUE.js and wanted to apply my knowleadge in a practical project. 

I realized a simple website that, using a free API from the New York Times, allows people to 
search for articles and save them as favourites. 

At the time I didn't have any design knowleadge and honestly didn't focus much on the website design
as I mostly wanted to apply my front-end skills and just make a functioning website.

You can see the working final results here http://intime.stellarsolutions.it/#
